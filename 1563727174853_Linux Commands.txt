Links are Collections to the pointers whatever the data added in source automatically gets added we can link between files to files and directory  to directory
Soft Links - 
Hard Links - Can Link B/W file to file but can't link between Directory-to-Directory. Hard Link files can't identify which is the source file or the destination file. Inode number and size are the same. In Hard link if we remove the source file we can access the destination file.

			VI

In Linux, their are many editors like vi,vim,gedit.
vi is a classic screen based editor
vim is vi improved enhanced programers support coloring,highlights (from 5.5)
There are three modes
insert modes,command modes,colon modes
Insert Mode - we can write the data (press i to insert, ESC + : +wq (to save),ESC + q! (to unsave) for save & quit SHIIFT+Z+Z)
Escape Mode - (ALL COMMANDS WILL BE WORK WITH ESCAPE MODES ONLY)
ESC + O(Captial O ) - to goto above the line
ESC + :set nu (For Number Line) , ESC + :set no nu (For No Number Line)
For Copy yw (For Word) and for Paste p
For Copy yy (For Lines) and for Paste p
For Copying Number of words/Lines for n times (ny) (eg  10y)
For Cut x (For Character)
For Delete dd (For Line) , Multiple Lines Delete ndd (eg. 10dd), For delete n Words ndw (eg. 10dw )
For Undo u
For Redo CTRL + SHIFT + R
For Searching :/<word>
For Encrypt SHIFT + : + X & set Password (It Will Work In VIM)
For Decrypt SHIFT + : + X & set Password Null & : + wq

                   Types of user

Root,Normal -(Network & Sudo),System - (have UID)
UID - for system & Kernel Purpose (For Root & Kernel 0 is uid)
UID  Starts from 1-499 (Actually 1-199) (For System User)
UID  Starts from 499-69000 (For Normal User)

At the time of creation of user by default
home directory - /home/sam(Default user created by root (user_name -sam))
Mail directory - /var/mail/sam
and uid,gid,shell are created

When at the time of creation
/etc/passwd - user information file
/etc/shadow - user password file
/etc/group  -group information file
/etc/gshadow - group password file

To add user
-->useradd <username> OR -->adduser <username>

Open Shadow file
Dhanis:X:502:502::/home/Dhanis:/bin/bash   
Description of above what it is(username:Pointer to Password :uid:gid:home_directory:shell)

Group File
--> vim /etc/group    (eg. group has Dhanis:x:502: ) Description is (group_name:pointer_to_password(ie. gshadow):gid:)

shadow file
--> vim /etc/shadow   (eg. Dhanis:!!:18086:0:99999:7:::) Description is (username:if password assign then Encrypt OR !! : 1(see down) : 2(see down) : 3(see down) : 4(see down) : 5(see down) )
the number of days since the last password changed it will calculate from jan 1970
the minimum number of days before password will change
number of days after which password must be changed
number of days warning will display to user before the account expiry
future use

Delete user
--> userdel <username> (Here user will be deleted but not home directory)

Delete user and home directory
--> userdel -r <username> (Here all will be delted user as well as home directory)

usermod (User)
-c comment
-u uid
-g gid
-s shell
-d directory


--> usermod <options> <uid_number> <username> (eg. usermod -u 502 ad [for UID Change] )
--> id <username> (eg. for checking id's ) 
--> usermod <options> <uid_number> <username> (eg. usermod -g 500 ad [for GID Change we have to use ony available groups number] )
--> usermod <options> <directory_path> (eg. usermod -d /dhanis/ad [for Directory Change] )
(For changing Shell)
--> usermod -s /sbin/nologin <username> (For Shell 
--> usermod -s /bin/bash <username> 

Lock User
-->usermod -L <username>

password
--> passwd <username> 

GROUPADD
--> groupadd <groupname> (eg. groupadd IT)

--> usermod <options> <groupname> <username>(eg. usermod -G [for secondary] Dhanis IT)

Add multiple users to group
--> usermod <options> <groupname>,<groupname> <username>(eg. usermod -G [for secondary] Dhanis IT)
					
seee the user group
--> vim /etc/group

delete a group
--> groupdel <groupname>  (eg. groupdel IT)

password for group
--> gpasswd <groupname> (eg. gpasswd IT)

remove the password
--> gpasswd -r <groupname> (eg. gpasswd -r IT)

To open etc of paticular 
getent passwd <username> (eg. getent passwd Dhanis)


Skelton File (Whenever we create user it has skeleton file and it is in hidden format )
--> cd /etc/skel/

For changing information for user (Seen in /etc/shadow/ [in this maximum password,]
chage <user> (eg. All information we can change here) 

Sudo user      [SEEE]
-->vim /etc/sudoers and give permission

To change ownwer and group owner
--> chown <username> <directory/files> (eg. chown Dhanis ad)

To change Group
-->chgrp <groupname> <directory/files> (eg. chgrp Dhanis ad)

Special Permission
We set gid to 2

--> chmod g+s <directory_name> (eg. chmod g+s 

Sticky bit is special permission for normal user. Value of sticky bit is 1

-->chmod o+t <directory_name/files> (eg. chmod o+t commands) (Permission of g+s for other and S is for groups)

                          Access Control List 

ACL is to used for giving different permissions to different users and different permissions to groups

check ACL permission
--> getfacl <directory_name> (eg. getfacl Dhanis)

Giving Full permission for Users
--> setfacl <options> u:<user_name>:<permission> <directory_name> (eg. setfacl -m u:tom:rwx a) (m-modify)

Giving Full permission for group
--> setfacl <options> g:<group_name>:<permission> <directory_name> (eg. setfacl -m g:AWS:rwx a) (m-modify)

Removing permission for users
--> setfacl <options> <username> <directory_name> (eg. setfacl -x tom a) (x-remove)

Removing permission for groups
--> setfacl <options> g:<groupname> <directory_name> (eg. setfacl -x g:AWS a) (x-remove)

When we remove acl then also their is "+" sign because we have remove it in binary level not in kernel level

To remove from kernel level
-->setfacl -b <directory_name> (eg. setfacl -b a)

To see the disk list

--> fdisk -l

To create the partition
-->fdisk /dev/sda/
-->m (help)
-->n(create the partition with disk size)
-->w(to create and to write into the disk)

To update the disk created command is
--> partx -a /dev/sda

Making disk partition with file system
--> mkfs.ext4 /dev/<partition_you_have_created>   (eg. mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda5)

Files system is nothing but giving structure to the partitions without file system we can't perform read,write operations

To see all the file system 
--> cat etc/filesystems

Block Id / UUID(Unique ID)
--> blkid <device_name/partition_name> (eg. blkid /dev/sda5)

Mount is the process of attaching the file system or partitions to the mount point/ directory

types of mounting

Temporary - In Temporary, if we mount the file system/partitions after reboot connecting B/W mount point and file system will not be there
Permanent - In Permanent, attaching will be their 

create a mount point 
--> mkdir /mount
--> mount /dev/<partition_name> <mount_point>/   (eg. mount /dev/sda5 /mount/)  (This Mount will be temporary)

To see the disk 
--> df -h

To see the disk & File System
--> df -hT

For permanently mounting Edit /etc/fstab (File system table file)
--> vim /etc/fstab
--> /dev/<partition_name>  /mount  ext4  defaults   0 0    [Description(partiton   mount   file_system   permissions(RWX)  dump(backup)(For backup 1)  scanning(For Virus,etc)(For scanning-2 1-checking 0-No checking))]
--> save & quit
--> mount -a (It will mount all the partitions which we make the changes in /etc/fstab)

Delete the partition

first unmount
-->umount /mount/
-->fdisk /dev/sda
--> select d
--> select w

                            Swap Partition

To create a swap 
--> fdisk /dev/sda
--> select n
--> size +500M
--> select t
--> select 6
--> select 82 (To check 82 type L then see which you want) (Here we chnge the system Id to recognize the kernel)(Here we create a raw file do the formatting)
--> select w

-->mkswap /dev/<swap_partition_name>  (eg. mkswap /dev/sda6)

To check swap partition
-->swapon -s

To active the swap partition

To deactive swap partition
--> swapoff /dev/<swap_partition_name> (eg. swapoff /dev/sda6)

                    LVM
LVM is used to shrik and extend the size of volume during runtime.
LVM is used to bring the file system capability,availability and perfomance during runttime.
In LVM their is three object
PV (Physical Volume) Physical volume is normal partition. It has ID 8e (#Required)
VG (Volume Group) - Is a collection of one or more physical volume
LV (Logical Volume)

To create a PV 
[First create a Disk]
--> fdisk /dev/sda
--> select n
--> give size
--> select t
--> select 8e
--> select w

--> pvcreate /dev/<partition_disk> (eg. pvcreate /dev/sda6 /dev/sd7 /dev/sda8)
--> pvs (pv size)
--> pvdisplay (to display pv's)

To create a logical volume
-->vgcreate <vgName> <partition_name>   (eg. vgcreate  )
-->vgdisplay

To Create a LVM
-->lvcreate -n <lvmname> -L 200M <vgname>
--> mkfs.ext4 /dev/<vgnmae>/<lvmname>
--> lvs (lv size)
--> mkdir mount(Mount_Point)
--> mount /dev/<vgname>/<lvmname> <mount_point>


                     		       LVM

   		                      Resize
   			       	      / \  
				     /   \
		              Extended  Reduce


-->vgextend <vgname> <partition_disk_to_extend>  (eg. vgextend CVB /dev/sda10)
-->lvextend -L +100M /dev/<vgname><lvmname>

To reduce lvm
to unmount
->umount /dev/<vgname><lvmname>  (eg. umount /dev/MYVG/MYLVM)

to scan the file system of the partitions
-->e2fsck -f /dev/<vgname>/<lvmname> (-f forcefully)  (e2fsck -f /dev/MYVG/MYLVM)

to reduce lvm
--> resize2fs /dev/<vgname>/<lvmname> size   (eg. resize2fs /dev/MYVG/MYLVM 50M)
--> lvreduce -L 100M /dev/<vgname>/<lvmname> (lvreduce -L 50M /dev/MYVG/MYLVM )
--> lvs
--> mount

to reduce the vg
--> vgreduce <vgname> <partiton_name>   (eg. vgreduce MYVG /dev/sda10)

To remove LVM
--> umount <mylvmnae>
-->lvremove <lvmname>

to remove vg
--> vgremove <vgname>

to remove pvs
--> pvs (To see all pv's)
--> pvremove /dev/<partition_name>  (eg. pvremove /dev/sda7 /dev/sda8 /dev/sda9)
--> fdisk -l (After removing pv's remove the physical drive also)
--> fdisk /dev/sda
--> select d
--> select <disk_number>
--> select w
--> partx -a /dev/sda


                                                          RAID

Hardware RAID - We are using hardware raid controllers. Raid is used to provide security to data if OS get crashed we can recover the data very RAID controller
H/W Raid is more expensive 
Software RAID - In S/W Raid their are
RAID 0 (Stripping) -  No security of data and writing is faster than reading. One or more disk is required (Here parallel are done but hard disk fails then data can't be recovered)
RAID 0 (Concatenation) - No security of data and reading is faster than writing. (Here serial are done but hard disk fails then data can be recovered)
RAID 1 (Mirroring) - If one hard disk crashed then we can recover the data. Two or more hard disk is required. Reading is faster than writing security of data is their
RAID 5 (Parity) - In parity we require more than two hard disk partition will acts as a hard disk. Data security is their. Writing is faster than reading.

-->lvcreate <vgname> -L +100M i 1 (i for number of hard disk)

create RAID 1 Mirroring
--> lvcreate <vgname> -L +100M(Give Size) -n <give_lvmname_RAID> -m 2   (-m for mirroring,-n for lvmname)

create RAID 5 Parity 
--> lvcreate <vgname> -L +100M(Give Size) -n <give_lvmname_RAID> -type raid5


							Journaling  

File system journaling is the advance version of file system to repair the file system at the time of read write permission
Journal files are present in the area which can't be accessed by any users these files are used to recover the files/data
File system journaling are availabel in ext3,ext4 and xfs(File System used in RedHat) system
Journal File Contains Metadata of system.

In Linux their are three types of security
SE Linux
IP tables
TCP Wrappers


SE Linux -SE Linux is a security enhanced linux used to monitor demaons or process and the file which are accessed by user (It is a file based linux security)
It Works on modules known as LSM ( Linux Security Module). 

To chech se linux status
--> sestatus

					     SELINUX
					  /    \      \
			                 /      \      \
			     	   Enforcing Permissive Disabled

To check currently SE linux working mode
--> getenforce

To Change SE linux Mode Temporarly
--> setenforce 1           (Modes: 1-Enforcing(Active), 0-Permissive(Inative))

Change the Mod Permanently
--> lokkit --selinux <Mode>    (eg. lokkit --selinux Enforcing/Permissive/Disabled)
--> etc/selinux/config         (Through Configuration)

For giving permission to file based linux se has two types : Context and boolean
--> ls -ld /var/ftp/pub

--> ls -lzd /var/ftp/pub (To check the context of the directory)

system_u:object_r:public_content_t (Description is down)

system_u: user it indicates types of user that is login to the system if a user loged as a root they will have a user value as a root if other user created directory then user_u (Here system_u means created by root)
object_r: object_r is a role for the particular file or folders (As a admin or normal user)
public_content_t : Type of a permission given by

To check the type of permission 
--> man selinux       (To see the types of permission is given by)

Boolean are set of binary used for security in SELinux

To check boolean
-->getsebool -a

To set boolean
--> setsebool -P allow_ftpd_anon_write_on
--> setsebool -P allow_ftpd_full_access_on


For uploading to read and write
--> chcon -R <permission> <directory_name> (eg. chcon -t public_content_rw_t /var/ftp/pub )
--> ls -lZd /var/ftp/pub  (Here these "system_u:object_r:public_content_t" will come)

Connect to ftp server
--> ftp <ipaddress_of_server>
--> ftp
--> cd pub
--> mkdir <directory_name>  (when directory is created then public acess if not set boolean)

                                               TCP

In hosts.allow file we will enter whom we want to give access

To allow particular to connect 
--> vim /etc/hosts.allow
--> set vsftpd:<urlname>     (For Allowing

To denied a particular network

It is a firewall for linux front-end tool to manage the net filter module which is integrated within the lnux kernel
Their are three tables available with IP tables
NAT -  NAT table is responsible for address translation
Filter - Filter table is responsible for filtering the packets
Mangle - Mangle table is responsible for packet marking

Process Are :- 

IP tables

Chain
-A Add
-D Delete
-R Replace
_I Insert

Layer 3 Objects
-s source
-d destination
-p protocol
--s source port
--d destination port

Jump
-J ACCEPT/REJECT/DROP (jump to the specified target chain)
ACCEPT  -allow incoming packet 
REJECTS -allow outgoing packet without acknowledge
DROP    -allow outgoing packet with acknowledge

To flush
--> iptable -F   (F-Flush)

To add a particular ip address to table with action type
--> iptables -A INPUT -s <source_IP> -d <destination_IP> -j <Action_type>  (eg. iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.103.133 -d 192.168.130.134 -j DROP)  (Can go and see in ping command) 

To see the IP tables
--> iptables -l 

To add a particular ip address to table with action type
--> iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport <port_number> -s <source_IP> -d <destination_IP> -j <Action_type>  (eg. iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.103.133 -d 192.168.130.134 -j DROP)  (Can go and see in ping command) 

To see the IP tables in number form
--> iptables -nL

To delete
--> iptables -D INPUT <number>      (eg. iptables -D INPUT 1)

                                          SSH Server

--> vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
--> uncomment line 13 (Remove #)
--> save & quit
--> service sshd restart
 
                  [CLIENT SIDE]

--> ssh <ipaddress>
--> give Password

				SCP (Secure Copy)

File copy from one system to another system without login
--> scp -R <source_file> <destination>:<path>

Centralized Log

--> vim /etc/rsyslog.conf
--> add ipaddress   (*     192.168.130.131)
--> service rsyslog restart
--> chkconfig rsyslog on

Types of logs (disk device log,authentication logs,Emergency logs, Booting Logs)

IP - Network Address + Host Address

see all the network
-->ls /etc/sysconfig/newtwork-scripts/

check the hostname
--> hostname

chnage the hostname permanently
--> vim /etc/hosts
--> 192.168.130.133 (Add host)

				NMAP (Network MAP)

NMAP uses for port scanner

Install nmap
--> yum install map
--> nmap <ipaddress>
--> netstat -s

cron scheduler is a default scheduler in a linux and the deamons used for cron is crond
--> crontab -e (a-list e-edit)
--> 15 15 12 07 /bin/date >> <file/directory> 

To remove a crontab
